this project was built using express v.5 and postgresql for the databases, you can read package.json to implement secure and functional logic based on installed library on this project.
todo:
- Based on the logic controller that has been created, adjust the configuration of routes, middleware and also its app.js.
- Analyze the overall code and structure of the folder so that the placement is in accordance with the needs I apply
- You can overhaul some code, but that's enough to get there, not to the point of running the NPM script
